1. merge roads-ssr and roads-spa into a single project that allows you to do either on a page by page basis
2. create `create-roads-app` so you can `npx create-roads-app` and it has some cli prompts, pulls everything down and starts an empty project
3. add some additional cli functionality if it recognizes the app already exists, like add a new named example project
